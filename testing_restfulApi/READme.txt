To test our API were using
**Mocha: Testing Environment //which allows Asynchronous testing.
**Chai: Assertion Library

The test-related packages mocha, chai, chai-http are saved in the
dev- dependencies

The routes are no more than standard routes, GET, POST, DELETE, PUT.
By testing single routes within independent blocks we get clear output.
And we have several tests that can be repeated with a single command line.

in the command line run: npm start //to start the server in development
in the command line run: npm test //to test the Api
